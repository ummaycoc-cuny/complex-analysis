# Complex Analysis, 2017-2018

These are notes for the Complex Analysis course taught at the CUNY Graduate
Center during the 2017-2018 Academic Year. They are based on the book by
the professor, which is yet to be published. He retains all rights to his
work, and this is a derivative work meant for educational purposes.

The notes are a condensed tour of the text--main ideas are plucked and either
paraphrased or quoted verbatim, with an emphasis on being a succinct resource
for studying.

Changes are accepted via the [fork/pull-request workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).
